defmodule MishkaGervaz.Form.Web.State.ApplyPresentationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A mount's own presentation choices, over the ones the resource declared.

  The resource has one `form` section; the surfaces that mount it do not know the same things. The
  Media library has to ask which site a file belongs to. The page builder's Assets sheet already
  knows, because the page being edited belongs to one — so it hides the field and has no Create
  button, because its dropzone is the submit.

  What is pinned here is that BOTH of those are opt-in: a mount that passes neither assign gets a
  state identical to the one it got before this existed.
